  <h2>About Me</h2>
   <section class="container">

      <h3>Meet 4 Walk!</h3>
      <p>This app combines my coding principles. It allows users to create groups, schedule open events, 
        while sending invitations to the group memebers. Then it uses map api to set a location for the 
        events. All users on the platform can see the date, time, and location of events in order to attend 
        if they choose to. The languages used include HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>

      <p>The main challenge and learning in this project came from the map api. Using it to create live 
        events and locations is a challenge but it was worth it. Map apis are a common and effective tool 
        in the modern world in which everyone uses GPS to figure out where they are going.</p>

      <h3>Size Shopper</h3>
      <p>This app demonstrates one of the most common and necessary coding skills needed today, creating an online store. It 
        filters items in order to help customers find what they're looking for easily. It uses the basic web languages including
      html, javaScript, and JQuery</p>F

      <p> The main reason I wrote this app is to be able to demonstrate my ability to create an online store experience. In our 
        increasingly online world a vital tool for web developers is the ability to create e-coomerce platforms effectivly.</p>
